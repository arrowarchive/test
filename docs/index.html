<p>This is a homework page I have to make for DIGIT 110. My name's Rachel, I'm a digital artist, I did this assignment last semester for another class, that's all you need to know.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>You can click on my plush collection on the left to go to my art website/portfolio (I couldn't pick a drawing, blame my indecisiveness)</li>
        <li>You can click the picture on the right to go to the <i>Instagram</i> page for <i>The Bold Media Group,</i> of which I am one of the heads of web development (shameless self promotion, but hey, the club just started, so cut me some slack)</li>
            <li>And lastly, if you think my plush collection is adorable and want to get one for yourself, the store I bought them from is right <a href="https://www.tastypeachstudios.com/collections/plushies">here</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>My <a href="https://arrowarchive.github.io/The-Arrowarchive/index.html">art portfolio</a> is more deserving of your time.</p>
